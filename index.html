    <h1>This website is in the making.</h1>
    <p>I am currently in the process of learing web development, so don't expect anything to look pretty.</p>
    <p>Shoutout to Live Server for making this possible! (Or at least a lot easier).</p>
    <p>Ok so Live Server doesn't actually change the Git Repo files, just show's what it'll look like in real-time...</p>
    <h2>Testing Section:</h2>
    <p>Testing 1 2 3... Testing 1 2 3...</p>
    <p>Update: The gradient works! Thank you dev tools!</p>
